#Exploratory data analysis using linear regression model
 ##Hello world my name is Benjamin nyaga.
I am an upcoming data analyst and this is my project
**This project is about solving a technology problem
Of machine learning algorithms
###Technologies used:
-python programming
-Machine learning 
-I underwent a series of steps to to accomblish the task 
Which involved
  *Analysing a medical insurance dataset 
   *Extracting some desirable features from the dataset
    *Building a machine learning algorithm 
    *Training the machine learning algorithm
    *Fitting the machine learning algorithm with the trained data
   *Evaluating the linear regression model in terms of RMSE,MAE and MSE
####STEPS INVOLVED
1.importing python libraries
2.loading the dataset for analysing
3.Cleaning the data to extract features that can be understandiable to a machine
4.Python modules to design a Linear regression model
5.Training the machine learning using the cleaned data
6.Using the machine learning model to predict the possible outcomes 
  


The uploaded file above shows the full explanation of the steps used 
#####The aim of the project was to solve the linear regression model in terms of RMSE MAE and MSE
