## 1.	Introduction

In this project, I build a Simple Linear Regression model to study the linear relationship between Age, sex, region, ibm and the target variable "charges" of the medical insurance dataset. I discuss the basics of linear regression and its implementation in Python programming language using Scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is the popular machine learning library of Python programming language.

## 3.	Python libraries

I have Anaconda Python distribution installed on my system. It comes with most of the standard Python libraries I need for this project. The basic Python libraries used in this project are:-

 •	Numpy – It provides a fast numerical array structure and operating functions.
 
 •	pandas – It provides tools for data storage, manipulation and analysis tasks.
 
 •	Scikit-Learn – The required machine learning library in Python.
 
 •	Matplotlib – It is the basic plotting library in Python. It provides tools for making plots.
