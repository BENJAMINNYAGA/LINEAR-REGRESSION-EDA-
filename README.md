## 1.	Introduction

In this project, I build a Simple Linear Regression model to study the linear relationship between Sales and Advertising dataset for a dietary weight control product. I discuss the basics of linear regression and its implementation in Python programming language using Scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is the popular machine learning library of Python programming language.
